# 🎲 Pick Game: A Fun Dice Game

Welcome to **Pick Game**, an exciting multiplayer dice game where two players compete to reach 100 points first. This project was designed to practice and reinforce essential JavaScript, HTML, and CSS skills by implementing game logic, DOM manipulation, and user interaction.

## 🛠️ Current Status

The game is currently in development. Some features may not be fully implemented, and there may be bugs or incomplete functionality.

## 🚀 About the Game

Pick Game is a two-player dice game where players take turns rolling a dice to accumulate points. Here's how the game works:

1. **Rolling the Dice**: Each player can roll the dice to get a number between 1 and 6. The number rolled gets added to the player's current round score.
2. **Holding the Score**: Players can choose to "hold" their score, which adds the current round score to their total score and ends their turn.
3. **Rolling a 1**: If a player rolls a 1, they lose their current round score, and the turn switches to the other player.
4. **Winning**: The first player to reach 100 points wins the game!
5. **Resetting the Game**: At any point, the game can be reset to start over.

## 🎮 Features

- **Two-player mode**: Play against a friend or challenge yourself!
- **Interactive UI**: Real-time updates for the current score, round score, and dice rolls.
- **Reset Functionality**: Easily restart the game with the click of a button.
- **Flowchart-based Design**: The game logic was designed using a flowchart, ensuring smooth gameplay and easy understanding of the code.
